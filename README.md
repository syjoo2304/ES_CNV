# CNV Analysis in Exome Sequencing Data

Welcome to the **CNV Analysis Repository**, dedicated to analyzing Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in exome sequencing data. This repository serves as a resource for bioinformaticians and researchers working on CNV detection, visualization, and interpretation using high-throughput sequencing data.

---

## **Project Purpose**

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Provide a structured pipeline for **CNV analysis** in exome sequencing data.
- Offer scripts, tools, and workflows optimized for CNV detection and downstream analysis.
- Facilitate reproducible research with detailed documentation and examples.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Pipeline for CNV Detection**: Automates CNV identification using tools like [EXCAVATOR2](https://github.com/EXCAVATOR2), [EXOMEDEPTH].
- **Visualization Tools**: Scripts for generating CNV plots to interpret results effectively.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adaptable to different datasets and sequencing platforms.
- **Reproducibility**: Clear workflows to ensure consistent and reliable results.
